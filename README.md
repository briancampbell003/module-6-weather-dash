# module-6-weather-dash

## Purpose
This project required using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create from scratch

## Coding Process and Obstacles
I started with the HTML framework for parts of the page then began the Javascript components.

## Future developments
Bug about first listed city from storage, and my suspicions about the problem. UV Index from API response. Further stylization options- particularly regarding opacity. Add alerts for fetch response problems. Hide page elements prior to first search.

## Credits

Something about fetch and tutor David, something about Dom traversal work with append and text methods in jQuery, specifically in the for-loop.
